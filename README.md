    LOGICAL REASONING ANSWERS - 8/10/2021
    Only II is sufficient.

    By knowing the 17th day of the month is a Saturday, we know that the 14th was a Wednesday.
    We can simply iterate backwards through the days of the week.

    Knowing that the last day of the month is a Wednesday only allows us to provide probabilities, as there are 7 months with 31 days, four with 30
    and finally one with either 29 or 28 depending on whether it's a leap year. We could provide probabilites based on this information, but not a
    definitive answer with the information provided in I.
